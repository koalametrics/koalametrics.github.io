Hi! We are KoalaMetrics and Sigmapoint, two tech companies from Krakow,Poland. 
Sigmapoint [https://www.sigmapoint.pl] is a Cracow based software company developing mobile apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and backend systems for both B2B/enterprise and startups. 
KoalaMetrics [https://www.koalametrics.com "KoalaMetrics website"] is a mobile analytics company where we deliver psychographic profiles of mobile users for telecoms, mcommerce and mobile app owners.

**Fresh Talks** are our regular morning tech talks combined with a healthy, fruity breakfast hosted by the team in our office. We start at 8:30 (seriously).

### 5 rules to tell you what it's all about:

1. **It's a morning meeting.** We start eating at 8:30 and the presentation kicks off at 8:40.
2. **It's technical.** We'll include some business/project management talks every now and then, but when it doubt, check rule #2.
3. **No cake policy.** You can count on yoghurt, muesli and fruit.
4. We do it to **learn from each other.** A 30 min-long presentation (slides are not required), then Q&A and problem solving.
5. KoalaMetrics and Sigmapoint teams will be there, because we organise it and this is where we hang out on Wednesdays. **Feel free to join** us but please, let us know in advance,
