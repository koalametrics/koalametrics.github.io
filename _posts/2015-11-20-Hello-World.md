We are KoalaMetrics and Sigmapoint, two tech companies from Krakow, Poland.

[**Sigmapoint**](https://www.sigmapoint.pl "Sigmapoint website") is a Cracow based software company, developing mobile apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and backend systems for both B2B/enterprise and startups. 

[**KoalaMetrics**](https://www.koalametrics.com "KoalaMetrics website") is a mobile analytics company, where we deliver psychographic profiles of mobile users for telecoms, mcommerce and mobile app owners.


**Fresh Talks** are our regular morning tech talks combined with a healthy, fruity breakfast hosted by the teams in our office at hubraum Krakow. We start at 8:30 (seriously).

For more details about how and why we do it, have a look at the [**About**](http://koalametrics.github.io/about/) section. FreshTalks are organised primarily to allow us to learn from each other and get better at what we do. We talk, ask questions and invite cool guests and the last thing we want is to forget it all. That's why this blog was created. It is a place where we want to publish notes, links, cheatsheets, videos and other informative content related to FreshTalk presentations.


We have started organising FreshTalks in April 2015 and until now we have managed to cover a variaty of subjects including:


+ React.js
* Pure Script
+ Routing DSL in Spray.io
* How to tame Akka Strings?
* frozen-flask + node
* 3D graphic design in Metal using new Apple API
* Immstruct, cursors, reference cursors & react.js
* Text mining and optimizing search algorithms for e-commerce.
* EC2 (elastic cloud computing) i VPC (virtual private cloud) 
* Lessons learnt on the way to 2 million downloads of OmniCalculator
* A terrible beacon-Android romance
* Create your first IntelliJ Plugin with Scala
* React Native:Android
* Beacons State of the Union
* Jupyter. If only Galileo coded. 
* Developing in Swift 2.0. In other words - what we've learnt writing 10+ KLOC iOS app in pure Swift.

And it's only going to get better!
