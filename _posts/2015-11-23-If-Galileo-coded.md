Open source, interactive data science and scientific computing across over 40 programming languages.

## Project Jupyter

According to [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) website, the whole idea was born in 2014 as one of the outcomes of IPython Project.  It was meant “to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages”.

We've heard about the so called “conflict” between R and Python supporters, so Sebastian Perwel got our attention immidiately when he mentioned Jupyter – a web-based program for statistical data analysis using script programming languages, that is said to be the solution. Why is it interesting? Should you care?

To keep it short we converted the key findings from our meeting into the image below, but you’re welcome to dig deeper. Sebastian wrote a post in Polish explaining all the main issues and you can visit it [here.](http://perseba.github.io/blog/jupyter-wprowadzenie.html)
