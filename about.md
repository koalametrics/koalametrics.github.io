Fresh Talks are our regular morning tech talks combined with a healthy, fruity breakfast hosted by the team in our office. We start at 8:30 (seriously).

### 5 rules to tell you what it's all about:

1. **It's a morning meeting.** We start eating at 8:30 and the presentation kicks off at 8:40.
2. **It's technical.** We'll include some business/project management talks every now and then, but when it doubt, check rule #2.
3. **No cake policy.** You can count on yoghurt, musli and fruit.
4. We do it to **learn from each other.** 30 min-long presentation (slides are not required), then Q&A and problem solving.
5. KoalaMetrics and Sigmapoint teams will be there because we organise it and this is where we hang out on Wednesdays. Feel free to join us but please, let us know in advance,
